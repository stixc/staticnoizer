# StaticNoizer
![Screenshot of StaticNoizer.](https://files.catbox.moe/v2aru0.png)

A simple brown/white noise player made with Godot. The intention is for people to be relaxed, for those who are on their computer, and have loud things around them that can drive them into insanity.
## Installation
Download the specified binary from the releases tab, and put it somewhere where you can open it easily. I recommend putting it in C: (example: C:/StaticNoizer), and while your at it, make a shortcut to StaticNoizer, and put it on both your desktop (and/or taskbar), and C:\Users\(Your Username)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs as well. Click on StaticNoizer.exe to open it, controls are super simple to understand.
## Compiling
You need Godot 3.5.2 in order to compile StaticNoizer. Clone the repository, I recommend C:, then open Godot and import the folder in which the StaticNoizer source is in. Afterwards, compile it like how you would compile any other Godot app.
## Why?
**The reason this exists is because I have autism & auditory sensory issues, and at the same time, I am currently living somewhere with god awful acoustics.** I keep on hearing noises that annoy the hell out of me, like dogs, birds, etc, and it's gotten so painful for my mind that I wanted to figure out a way to relax and do things without feeling stressed. I don't find relaxed music to work as much as it used to, since I want something that can genreate a wall of sound rather than something that's quiet and mellow. Also loud music like metal, EDM, or any other loud & fast genre can't work because it can cause major ear damage since it's utilizing melodies, which involve specific frequencies, which can result in hearing loss.<br>
<br>
My solution to all this? **Static,** as in white noise, however I don't use plain white noise, as it's extremely loud and can cause hearing damage. The real solution is filtered white noise, or brown noise. Now there are white/brown noise generator apps out there, but none are simple or non-bloaty as mine. Most apps I find are mostly exclusive to the Microsoft Store, and most of them are just crummy YouTube videos that have a fade out for no reason, combined with microtransactions. That won't cut it, so I needed to make my own.<br>
<br>
After all that, I made the first iteration of StaticNoizer, known as *WhiteNoizer,* which was a simple batch script that opens Windows Media Player, and plays a 30min loop of brown noise, in which the crap quality MP3 I made of it takes up 200MB because of it's length. Knowing this, and because it's pretty jank to use Windows Media Player for stuff like this, I decided to code up a superior version in Godot. I was originally wanting to make this in Clickteam Fusion instead, but considering I'm on a Godot roll, and I've seen applications be made with Godot, this will do.
